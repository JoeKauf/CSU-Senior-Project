# Anticipated Graduation Salary Generator

This program will calculate an expected salary for new graduates based upon
salary, school, and location. This information will be accessible through a PHP
server online where the user can select from dropdown boxes their school, major,
and the location they would like to work in. The information behind these dropdowns are
stored in a MySQL database. This database utilizes webscraping using Python.
C++ or Python will be used to process the data before inputting it into the database.
Finally the calculated information will be output and displayed using a Tableau table.
