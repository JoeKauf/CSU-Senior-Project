# Draft Proposal: Anticipated Graduation Salary

## Problem Statement

New grads are offered a range of salaries from companies to choose from. Ideally
the student is aware of starting salaries for their profession. However, most
students have unrealistic salary expectations. According to a study referenced
by O'Shaughnessy, students estimate their starting salaries will be 23% higher
than reality. Students can forfeit good opportunities believing they are not
being paid as anticipated.

By creating software that collects and displays data on starting salaries from
different colleges, students will have more realistic expectations. This
software will find and analyze data so students will not have to. This program will enable students to focus on their studies
instead of having to research salaries which fullfills Charleston Southern University's mission. Students have unrealistic expectations
for salaries, but by creating computer software that finds and displays
realistic data, it can help correct these expectations.

## Project Description

This program will calculate an expected salary for new graduates based upon
salary, school, and location. This information will be accessible through a PHP
server online where the user can select from dropdown boxes their school, major,
and the location they would like to work in. The information behind these dropdowns are
stored in a MySQL database. This database utilizes webscraping using Python.
C++ or Python will be used to process the data before inputting it into the database.
Finally the calculated information will be output and displayed using a Tableau table.

## Proposed Implementation Language(s)

C++, MySQL, Tableau, PHP

## Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in in the proposed implementation languages(s)

N/A

## Additional Software/Equipment Needed

N/A

## Personal Motivation

As one who is interested in data analytics, this project will help me master
previously learned languages such as C++ and grow my database knowledge. This
database knowledge will be cultivated by learning new technologies that are
commonly used in the data analytics field such as Tableau, MySQL and PHP. The
experience one learns from using data visualization technology and data
collection will not only be a good resume piece, but an integral learning
experience.

## Outline of Future Research Efforts:

1.  Identify Websites for Data Collection

2.  Learn How to web scrape

3.  MySQL Training

4.  Learn How to Calculate Projected Salary

5.  Research How to use Tableau and Format Data Relevant Data

| Description:   | The project will consist of a frontend (PHP) that displays a Tableau Table with the projected starting salary and the backend which consists of the database (MySQL) and the webscrappers.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rationale:     | The program needs to have a backend for manipulating and mining data to calculate the starting salary. The frontend is used for the user to manipulate.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fit Criterion: | User inputs a location, degree, and major, and gets a starting salary that is comparable with the expected average starting salary within a 95% confidence interval.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Description:   | The project will be able to calculate a starting salary based upon location, major, and college. This information is stored in the database already form the webscraping and will be used to compute the starting salary.                                                                                                                                               |
| Rationale:     | The product will be useless without an accurate calculation of this data.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fit Criterion: | The salary will be fall within a 95% CI of the expected starting salary based upon preknown information.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Description:   | The front end will consist of a table and three dropdown boxes sorted in ascending order. The dropdowns boxes will be based on location, college, and major. The locations will be places with populations greater than 100,000 people in the USA. The dropdowns will have the ability to take string input to help find the location faster. |
| Rationale:     | The user needs to be able to select location, major, and school for the program calculate the anticipated starting salary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Fit Criterion: | Drop down menu is able to take string inputs and/or scrolling. The user must be able to select the chosen box. The table will output the an accurate graph matching the calculated values based upon the location.                                                                                                                            |

Icons will reflect the functional operations of the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
